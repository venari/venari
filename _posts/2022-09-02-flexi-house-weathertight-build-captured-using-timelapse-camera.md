Great to see some recent national media coverage for [Flexi House][flexi-house] using our new [time-lapse service][timelapse]. 

Flexi House helped us do one of our final field trials of our new timelapse cameras. 

This final trial helped iron out a few kinks and identified a few enhancements to be made.

Our timelapse cameras are optimised for long-term captures lasting months or years. Flexi House's 13-hours-to-weathertight build process is *slightly* faster than this!
