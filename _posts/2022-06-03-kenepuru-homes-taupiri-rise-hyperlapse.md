This was another fun project to work on with the awesome team at [Kenepuru Homes][kenepuru-homes], tracking the construction and completion of this beautiful new development in Titahi Bay.

Flying 11 different captures, and then applying some fairly detailed post-processing allows us to create the following hyperlapse showing the project's progress over the course of a year.

It's always interesting to compose footage and picture how the site is going to look in the future, from green field to finished construction!
